        <p>Hello, my name is M. Jahnavi. I have recently completed my Master's in Computer Applications (MCA) from Annamacharya PG College of Computer Studies, and during my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in software development, particularly in Java technologies.

        In addition to my formal education, I have hands-on experience with Spring Boot and Hibernate, and I’ve also worked with databases like MySQL and MongoDB. I have a solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming concepts, as well as front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        
        I’ve also trained in Full Stack Web Development, which allowed me to work on both front-end and back-end development, and I am keen to apply these skills in a real-world setting. I am familiar with Agile methodologies and have a good understanding of tools like Jenkins and Docker.
        
        While I am a fresher, I am highly motivated and eager to contribute to a team where I can grow and develop my skills. I am particularly excited about this opportunity because I want to apply my knowledge of Java development and learn more from professionals in the industry. I’m confident that my skills, combined with my passion for technology, will allow me to make a positive contribution to your team.
